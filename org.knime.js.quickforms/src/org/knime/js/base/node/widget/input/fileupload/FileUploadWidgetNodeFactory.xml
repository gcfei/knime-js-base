				Creates a file upload widget for use in components views. Variable
				output representing the file path as variable. In case an absolute
				file path is selected the node
				will populate two variables: one
				representing the path and one
				representing the URL. If a URL is
				selected
				as default file only the URL variable is defined.
			</p>
			<p>
				The node supports custom CSS styling. You can simply put CSS rules
				into a single string and set it as a
				flow variable 'customCSS' in the
				node configuration dialog. You will find the list of available
				classes
				and their description on our
				<a href="https://knime.com/css-styling">documentation page</a>
				.

		</intro>
		<option name="Label">A descriptive label that will be shown in the
			view.
		</option>
		<option name="Description">Some lines of description that will be shown in
			the view,
			for instance by means of a tooltip.
		</option>
		<option name="Valid File Extensions">
			A list of file extensions that is used as filter
			in the
			file browser (not only the one in the "Default File" option but
			also
			in a remote file browser), e.g. ".csv,.csv.gz" will filter for
			files ending with ".csv" or ".csv.gz". Leave empty to accept any
			file.
		</option>
		<option name="Default File">
			The file that will be used during design time, i.e. when no file
			is
			uploaded by means of the, e.g. KNIME WebPortal.
			<br />
			It is possible to enter a URL here. This can be useful if a default
			file is to be addressed with
			the knime:// protocol (e.g.
			knime://knime.workflow/../data/file.csv) or
			if the file is present on
			a remote server.
		</option>
		<option name="Timeout">
			The time in seconds after which the connection
			times out. The timeout is
			used when testing the existence of default
			files. The default is set
			to 1 second and should be sufficient in most
			cases.
		</option>
		<option name="Disable output, if file does not exist">
			If enabled, output port will be disabled, if the provided file does
			not exist or cannot be accessed.
			<br />
			This option is helpful in the wizard (WebPortal) execution to keep
			this and subsequent nodes from failing during execution.
		</option>
		<option
			name="Store uploaded file in workflow directory">
			Check this box to store the file in a temp directory in the workflow directory (e.g.
			/path/to/workflow/tmp/file_name). Otherwise, it will be created in the
			temp directory of the system, which can lead to unwanted behaviour,
			i.e. reader nodes do not allow direct access to the file system on KNIME Server or due to swapping a job 
			between systems in a server/executor environment. Note that the uploaded file will be deleted from the
			workflow when the workflow is discarded or reset.
