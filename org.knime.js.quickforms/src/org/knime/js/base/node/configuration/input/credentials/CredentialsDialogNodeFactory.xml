    <name>Credentials Configuration</name>

	<shortDescription>
	   Provides a credentials configuration option to an encapsulating component's dialog.

		<intro>
			<p>Outputs an credentials flow variable with a set value from a component's dialog.</p>
		</intro>
		<option name="Label">
		  A descriptive label that will be shown in the dialog
		</option>
		<option name="Description">
		  Some lines of description that will be shown for instance in the node description of the component exposing a
		  dialog.
		</option>
		<option name="Parameter Name">Parameter identifier for external parameterization (e.g. batch execution). 
		  This will also be the name of the exported flow variable.</option>
		<option name="Username">
			The username. 
		</option>
		<option name="Password">
			The password.
		</option>
		<option name="Prompt user name in wrapped metanode dialog/wizard">
			Whether the username should be a separate field in the configuration dialog of a (wrapped) metanode and wizard.
            If unset the username field will not be shown and the output will always the pre-configured username.
		</option>
        <option name="Save password in configuration (weakly encrypted)">
          Whether the password should be saved with the workflow. Note that, if saved, the password can be revealed
          with modest effort by looking at the encryption algorithm used in KNIME's (open) source code. If the password 
          is not saved (option not set) the user will be prompted for the password when the workflow is opened unless
          the node is already saved executed. In the latter case the password is not prompted assuming downstream 
          consumer nodes, e.g. a DB reader, are also executed and no longer need the credentials. In such cases 
          (resetting and) executing a downstream node will fail as the password is not part of the credentials object
          passed from this node into the workflow - a re-configuration of this node is required.
        </option>
        <option name="Use KNIME Server Login (when run on server)">
         If the node is executed as part of a job on the KNIME Server Web Portal the password is populated with the user
         credentials  the log-in user. 
        </option>
        <option name="Don't render input fields">
         When the server login and password are used it might be desirable to not display any input fields. When checking 
         this option the component will not display, but user name and password are still retrieved from server login credentials.
        </option>
