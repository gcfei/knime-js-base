    	<option name="Stall requests in node model">
    		If this option is set, the node model will stall requests issued by a random time between 0 and 5 seconds 
    		to simulate computation of the result. In case this option is not chosen the node model returns the dummy 
    		string issued by the request immediately.
    	</option>
    	<option name="Keep responses in order">
    		If the stall option is set, requests will be received by the view in a random order. Set this option 
    		to test keeping the responses in order in such a case.
    	</option>
    	<option name="Cancel previous requests">
    		If this option is set each issued request will cancel all previously issued, not returned requests.
